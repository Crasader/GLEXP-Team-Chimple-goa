6;It carries my kite higher and higher
6;It is fat with a big stomach
6;It is high up in the sky
6;It smashed into pieces on the ground
6;It tears my kite from my hand
6;Kato scratched his head and thought hard

6;Like them he did not give up
6;Lion was resting in the short grass

6;Magozwe would daydream of being a pilot
6;Meanwhile the eggs hatched one by one
6;Monkey kept running hoping to get away
6;Mother bought me a bright blue cap

6;Once there was a very hungry crocodile
6;One day a baby elephant was born
6;One day the longing was too strong
6;Only one thing I beg of you
6;Opio asked many questions about the night
6;Other people arrived at the bus stop
6;Perhaps this was the wife for him
6;Perhaps tomorrow I will find my kite
6;The door opened and Hyena ate Atabo
6;The farmer had a donkey too
6;The farmer never lets me rest
6;The moon tried on my cap

6;The plough is big and heavy
6;The river is full and strong
6;The smoke filled the entire room
6;The sun rose high and bright
6;The tortoise was afraid to go
6;The trees stretched their branches and smiled
6;The truck smashed into the car
6;The waters parted for a moment
6;The young crocodiles were always hungry
6;Then go back and search again
6;Then she began to run away
6;Then we went to the shop
6;There was a spider called Anansi
6;There was no sign of it
6;These berries are the colour indigo
6;They are so cold and sweet
6;They did not listen to Monkey
6;They had caught him as well

6;We will teach you a lesson
6;We will wait a bit longer
6;What are you looking at boy?

6;When mother was younger she was stronger
6;When will you stop your stupidity?
6;Where is my red ball now?
6;Where is the big blue bus?
6;Where were you all this time?
6;Where will we find all this?
6;Which animal left these eggs here?
6;Who is afraid of the lion?
6;Why do you have red eyes?
6;Will we crawl on our bellies?
6;Wind had an argument with the trees
6;Without heads we sleep very well
6;Yes mother I understand replied Kisirusiru
6;You added water in my milk
6;You have eaten all our maize
6;Your basket This basket is mine
6;Your parents will pay for this
6;Your voice is not like his
6;Zama is getting ready for school
7;A big truck was driving down the hill
7;A cow has strong teeth for grinding food
7;A policewoman opened the door to my room
7;Adhoch walked into the lake calling her sister
7;Adie is at the lake with her friends
7;After a while he called his doves again
7;After many days he came to a village
7;After the head left Adun packed her things
7;Akai and her mother went to the market
7;All of us went to the fun fair
7;All the animals jumped safely over the fire
7;An ambulance and the police came to help
7;Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth
7;Anansi replied Sorry I have things to do

7;Atabo tried to stand up to continue home
7;Aunt why are your ears so big today?
7;Aunt why are your eyes so big today?
7;Aunt why is your mouth so big today?
7;But Anansi was poor again with no friends
7;But he was swept away by the water
7;But on the way the paper got torn
7;But the sun did not listen to him
7;Do you see why the palm tree is important?
7;Do you think the sun needs a hat

7;She studied plants and how they grow
7;She studies Science Social Studies and Mathematics
7;She taught me the names of plants
7;She thought for a while
7;Sinson replied from under the big blanket
7;So Anansi went down to earth again
7;So away they went the third time
7;So he took a deep breath jumped
7;Some people gave up and went home
7;Soon blood was trickling down his face
7;Soon Rabbit was left poor and homeless
7;Sun sun please do not run away
7;That lady is having her hair done
7;The children never fought with each other
7;The clouds were sad to see all this
7;The deer could not see the tigers
7;The donkey and the ox were friends
7;The erotot took off one of his chains
7;The hyena and the tortoise were friends
7;The hyena ran to the trees energetically
7;The mountains put on their pretty green dresses
7;The other rat lived in a house
7;The seventh sun hid behind a hill
7;The shepherd loves this cow the most
7;The sun came up a little higher
7;The tortoise struggled slowly up the tree
7;The whole world began to sink under water
7;The woman looked down to see why the baby was laughing
7;The yolk of an egg is yellow
7;Their child was a boy called Kisirusiru
7;Then all the animals sang Ata kalio
7;There also lived a family of squirrels
7;There is a beautiful cow at home
7;There were colourful lines in the sky
7;These men are coming back from work
7;They both woke up confused and frightened
7;They complained because the bus was late
7;They did not want to carry me
7;They found a cave to live in
7;They grew limbs with feet and toes
7;They reached the end of their journey
7;They saw three men with huge sacks
7;They summoned Anansi and the Vulture again
7;They threw their leaves all over the place
7;They waited for the big blue bus
7;This tree lives when everything else is dry
7;Today I am not going to school
7;Toloto Akai ka itokeng ni imucuo usese
7;We are playing far from the house
7;We eat fruit from the palm tree
7;We eat many different kinds of food
7;We had to tell her the truth
7;We use palm tree seeds for fuel
7;We will have it for supper tonight
7;We will not crawl we will walk
7;What can I do about my skin?
7;What disease have you brought to us?
7;What is this dark thing following you?
7;When I stop spinning I look around
7;When mother grew older her back bent
7;When mother was younger we visited her friends
7;Whenever she came she sang the song
7;Who makes it happen?
7;Why do you have a long neck?
7;Yes now I can hear my breath
7;You see the goodies we eat here
7;You swim much faster than I do
7;You will learn to like the night
7;Your friend was lucky
8;Elephant fell over hard and hit a tree
8;Every day is a bad day for you
8;Excuse me Anansi did I hear you right
8;Finally a rooster offered to call the sun
8;Finally he dozed off and went fast asleep
8;Finally the web strings could hold no longer
8;Fox jumped and the fire caught his tail
8;Hamisi sees a boy wearing a beautiful shirt
8;Hare ran and hid himself in a tree
8;He and his new friend talked until morning
8;He asked them to wait for him there
8;He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax
8;He did the same thing the next day
8;He drove away without giving Dog his change
8;He enjoyed grazing the animals in the fields
8;He felt he could not live without her
8;He grabbed Demazane before she could run away
8;He had planned to make Monkey look foolish
8;He is surprised when he gets the change
8;He kept it safe in a clay pot
8;He knew he could easily slip and fall
8;He let the baby play with his chains
8;He opened and closed his eyes many times
8;He saw more people at the bus stop
8;He shared the room with two other boys
8;He watched when mother came to feed Atabo
8;He went closer and closer to the rock
8;High up there the birds are flying home
8;Honey covered him completely so he was hidden
8;How did you do this without a fire
8;Hyena swore that he would never again steal
8;I breathe in and out in and out
8;I found it here on the road side
8;I got into a car with the policewoman
8;I think she bought them in town today
8;I want my people to see the night
8;In a nearby village lived a timid tortoise
8;In Turkana County people keep many different animals
8;It has only one horn and no tail
8;It has red blue orange and green colours
8;It was in the town many kilometres away
8;Just like my grandmother used to make it
8;Khalai talks to the hedge round her school
8;Khalai talks to the tree at her school
8;Kisirusiru and his mother climbed down the tree
8;Little Ant had no water for many days
8;Long ago there was a foolish lazy jackal
8;Maid Kakembo was very close to princess Apenyo
8;Man suddenly found himself up a tall tree
8;Meanwhile the owner of the house was furious
8;Monkey did not know what was going on
8;Monkey will come to eat your maize today
8;Mother Sun decided to visit her sister the moon
8;Muthoni and I would play hide and seek
8;My friends this dark thing is called night
8;My wet body feels so cool cool cool
8;Oh let me help you my dear friend
8;On the way she talks to the grass
8;Once upon a time there lived two rats
8;One day come and visit me and see
8;One day Hare was out looking for food
8;One elephant is drinking water with the lion
8;One night Hare visited Rooster and his family
8;Opio was very thirsty so he drank some
8;Rooster decided to play a joke on Hare
8;Rooster stepped forward and gently crowed Kookoodokoo koo
8;She brushes her teeth with the lughano stem
8;She drowned in the same way as Adie
8;She got many presents for her hard work
8;She had nobody to take care of her
8;She had to do all the work herself
8;She is going out with her friends tonight
8;She kissed the moon goodbye and went home
8;She knows she paid her fare in full
8;She lets the children watch television at her shop
8;She opened the door and let him in
8;She passed her exams and received more presents
8;She pressed tiny seeds into the warm earth
8;She put the oily cakes into the horn
8;She runs for her life and screams Help
8;She took me home to my worried parents
8;She wanted them to be happy and free
8;She wanted to know more about the world
8;So Baby Elephant bent down lower and lower
8;So he went to look for the river
8;So the woman came down from the tree
8;Sometimes they were arrested sometimes they were beaten
8;Soon the drizzle turned into a heavy downpour
8;That is a very fine shirt thinks Hamisi
8;That is Ms Phone and her five cellphones
8;That night Apenyo crept out of the palace
8;The army of bubbles chases the germs away
8;The driver asked them to pay their fares
8;The elephant was sent out as a guard
8;The farmer was talking to his wife today
8;The Hare family decided to try it themselves
8;The men continued to disagree and started fighting
9;A glass on a windowsill crashes to the ground
9;A woman with her baby went into the forest
9;Adhoch studied and played when Adie was busy working
9;Adie was hard working neat kind and well behaved
9;Adun was scared but she did not run away
9;Akai and her mother went into a shoe shop
9;Altogether there were ten children living at that house
9;Anansi was too lazy to cook his own food
9;And he put the bag carefully in his hut
9;And they walked out together into their new world
9;As she went out the door she hugged me
9;As they sang each bird pecked out an eye
9;At bedtime we chop off our heads
9;At the American university Wangari learnt many new things
9;At the bottom of this pool were two snakes
9;Atabo would open the door and receive the food
9;Bontle and Mpho and Lerato go out and play
9;But Crocodile did not let go of her nose
9;But he did not listen to any of them
9;But I am so tiny what can I do
9;But one day Muthoni did not come to school
9;But soon it is ready for me to sip
9;But then he crashed down on the sleeping Lion
9;Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?
9;Come back and shine on us roared the lion
9;Crocodile chased Dog all the way to the river
9;Crocodile stormed inside and hit Dog with her tail
9;Do you know the seven colours of the rainbow
9;Each evening Demane brought back something he had killed
9;Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop
9;Even more people were running to catch the bus
9;Eventually Adun consulted a diviner about what to do
9;Finally they saw beehives in trees on a hill
9;Five antelopes and warthogs are walking to the water
9;For this reason the owner valued it a lot
9;Goat runs away from the sound of a car
9;Hamisi I have to buy your uniform says dad
9;Hare asked Elephant Please be kind and carry me
9;Hare was not able to sleep the whole night
9;He blew gently on her and she came alive
9;He closed the door and opened the bag himself
9;He did not know how to read the words
9;He fell into the river right among the crocodiles
9;He had a deep scar across half his face
9;He had no uncle or aunt to run to
9;He is the one who invited me
9;He met Elephant who had a pot of honey
9;He took a deep breath then he was gone
9;He was serious and patient never rude or disrespectful
9;He was very violent to anyone who disobeyed him
9;Her favourite time of day was just after sunset
9;Her grandchildren went to visit her during holiday time
9;His hair was long and fell on his back
9;His hard new shell of honey could protect him
9;His skin was burnt and his tail came off
9;I am waiting for you here outside our house
9;I know already I know
9;The men were furious especially the ugly leader
9;The milk in my cup is too hot
9;The next day the two animals met again
9;The owners caught him and started beating him
9;The rooster crowed again this time more boldly
9;The shade from a palm tree is always cool
9;The sound of the chains on his neck woke the baby
9;The step sisters loved each other very much
9;The tips of their tails split into two
9;The wind blows me away from the kite
9;The wisdom was free for everyone to share
9;The yellow one is for communicating with family
9;Then I can have it all to myself
9;Then Jackal saw a log across the path
9;Then one day there was a great storm
9;Then this man joined all the parts together
9;Then we took off our shirts and skirts
9;They arrived at the house of the head
9;They discussed the story for a long time
9;They must get home before it is dark
9;They realised that the young lovers had escaped
9;They welcomed each day just as it came
9;They will lay eggs for her to eat
9;They would travel in the big blue bus
9;This is the day we were waiting for
9;This man did not care about the child
9;This time he set a trap with sugar
9;Thomas came up and sat next to him
9;Today I am not going to watch TV
9;Today was a very bad day for me
9;We decided to stop and face the stranger
9;We make brooms and mats from palm leaves
9;We returned home without salt or cooking oil
9;We slowed down to look at the man
9;We use palm leaves to thatch our houses
9;We will make our home in the hills
9;What shall I do?
9;When Kalabushe arrived the house was very quiet
9;Where do you put your heads at night?
9;Why does your horn have a sharp point?
9;Women had no wood to make cooking fires
9;You are afraid and I was afraid too
10;I am waiting with my mother for a taxi
10;I cannot see it but I hear its din
10;I must go to the river I heard about
10;I think someone is pouring paint from the sky
10;I will not be able to get my uniform
10;I will take you home to meet my father
10;I will wait until she comes back to drink
10;If Magozwe complained or questioned his uncle beat him
10;If you look back the night will go away
10;Imagine how the meat looked when it reached home
10;It is a beautiful sheet hanging from the sky
10;It was a very hot Saturday afternoon in December
10;It was heavier than your plough I am sure
10;It will sweep you away warned a wise squirrel
10;Just put your stick next to me and measure
10;Kalabushe and her aunt were rescued by the villagers
10;Khalai wakes up and talks to the orange tree
10;Let us go up and see the earth above
10;Like a shoe in the middle of its face
10;Lion forgot his meal and ran for his life
10;Little Ant took a long sip of cool water
10;Long long ago there was a king called Kayanja
10;Many small animals lived together on the big tree
10;Monkey accepted without knowing what was waiting for him
10;Muthoni and I went to the village well together
10;My birds and I meet Chimpanzee in the tree
10;My family left me here when they moved on
10;My friend Kiki and I love to go exploring
10;My friend Kiki escaped I was not fast enough
10;My friends were not able to score any goals
10;My giraffes and I make monkey balls from clay
10;My gorilla and monkey fear Tortoise in every way
10;My parents and I worked in the small gardens
10;My pot is full of sweet potatoes and honey
10;My sister and I harvested the flowers and peas
10;No one had anything to eat except the crows
10;Nourished by sun and soil she grew leaves again
10;Now we know you are definitely one of us
10;Now we were both trapped in the dark room
10;Now with the suns gone there was darkness everywhere
10;Oh thank you my friend for protecting my basket
10;On the way home a very strong wind came
10;On the way we saw our friends playing football
10;Once I found Muthoni we would forget everything else
10;Once upon a time there lived a happy family
10;One day Opio went out hunting with his dogs
10;Perhaps my kite is still flying in the sky
10;Please grow strong and protect us from bad people
10;She lost Adhoch because she was jealous of Adie
10;She says this stick is longer than you are
10;She took her offspring for their first swimming lesson
10;She took me to the market to buy vegetables
10;She visits the sick and the elderly in their homes
10;Sister Moon lives on the other side of the sky
10;So that I can listen to my own body
10;Soon everyone else got in the small red bus
10;Take this fork and help me to stir it
10;Tell us what it is if we are wrong
10;That evening he began to walk towards his village
10;The animals were delighted and the humans felt relieved
10;The beehive and honey had dried on his back
10;The birds can either fly or come with us
10;The clouds were very happy to see mother Sun again
10;The driver was about to give Dog his change
10;The farmer took the donkey out to his field
10;The goal posts were made of two big stones
10;The machines were first spotted by the mole family
10;The next day the ox came home late again
10;The people were poor and the children were hungry
10;The small garden of flowers yielded sacks of flowers
10;The small garden of peas yielded sacks of peas
10;The squirrels birds insects wanted trees bushes and grass
10;The truck driver was talking on his mobile phone
10;The window curtains flutter and gently brush my face
10;Then he got in the front of the van
10;Then he realized that he was running behind Lion
10;There was a small window under the wooden planks
10;They asked Anansi the clever Spider to help them
10;They gave him a pot of dirty brown water
10;They lived in a peaceful village in the mountains
10;They were no longer snakes but Man and Woman
10;This annoyed the hyena who started yelling at Tortoise
10;Tortoise and I go home very slowly with Snake
10;Trevor asked Kategga to row them across the river
10;Wangari had helped them to feel powerful and strong
10;We played until the field was full of sand
10;We swam and swam and forgot about the time
10;We will look after the grass and the trees
10;We will not be able to go to town
10;When Dog returned to the river he met Crocodile
10;When Khalai returns home she visits the orange tree
10;When Sun left the mountains put on their white scarves
10;When the farmer came the ox closed his eyes
10;When the other cattle graze this one eats alone
10;White Dove was startled and flew away to safety
10;Will you help me before the others wake up
10;Yet I can smell the food mother is preparing
10;You can bring two so one can be mine
10;You have given me something very bad to drink
