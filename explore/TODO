follow width or height - and scale based on only one axis
    glasses (follow aspect ratio)
    hair, hat (dont follow aspect ratio)
    
    
only allow wdith adjustment as percentae of height and vice versa
    head/face


hand and legs - just scale in either axis based on pulling - and have max/min scale
    accessories of hand and leg - scale up or down with aspect ratio and follow the width/height (mostly width)
    

todo:
    hand and legs should be pairs - whatever happens to one - should happen to other: done
        but some accessories should not be paried: done
    scale according to max size and then stop: done
    some accessories should strech with the body and some should scale: done
    maintain gap between parts  : done  
    expand body always with aspect ratio - always scale first - if max scale has reached then expand the area: done
    min cutoff and max cutoff in width and height : done
    whole puppet should maintain size - so when one is scaled down - others should make up for it by scaling up: done
    refactor code so that we dont send pointer distance - but total scale increase or decrease to each accessory and limb as well: done
        the accessory should track only width or height of the limb or both: done

        click event should be on accessory as well not just mask
        
how to:
    support body less characters - face itself is a complete body
    support four legged or crawling creatures
